    :::info Naming Convention
    - Files and directorys: Use kebab-case (e.g., `module-2.mdx`, `module-1/`)
    - Numeric prefixes control the order in navigation (e.g., `01-topic-1.mdx` appears before `02-topic-2.mdx`)
    - File extensions: Use `.md` for plain markdown, `.mdx` when using React components (H5P component)

    The top level title, for this page `# Module x` will be the title represented in the left-hand navigation if no title is present the file name will be used.
