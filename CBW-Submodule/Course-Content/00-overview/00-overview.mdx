# Overview

This proposed course platform combines:
 
 - GitHub for file management.
 - Docusaurus to render the website.
 - H5P integration to embed interactive learning elements.

 ## Proposed Architecture

![Diagram](../images/diagram.svg 'Website Architecture')

The content within the RDM-Course folder can exist anywhere and be linked to the Course Site Repo. Alternatively the course content can also exist exclusively in the course site repo. The site itself can be hosted to any static site hosting service such as [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Render](https://render.com/docs/static-sites), [Surge](https://surge.sh/help/getting-started-with-surge) or self hosted on an OICR web server as outlined above.

The following pages describe in detail how the site works and how it is updated, maintained and deployed:
